- ReactJs is not a framework, it is a library
- to create a react project we need npm(node package manager)
- we get the npm from node js and hence we have to install node js to create a react project
- how do we create a react project ?
------------------------------------
	- CRA (create-react-app)
        - outdated
	- vite
		- popularity for its speed and performance
		- bundling time is less, almost half the time CRA takes. beacause it uses ESModule bundling whereas CRA uses webpack	
		- HMR - Hot module replacement
- lets create a reat project using vite
----------------------------------------
    - create a folder and open it in vscode
    - open the terminal in vscode(ctrl + `) and type the command
            npm create vite@latest
    - will ask for some options like name of project(give a name), framework(choose react - though react is not a framework), underlying language (choose javascript) 
    - now a react project is created without node modules folder
    - now use
        cd <project name>
    - now install node modules using
        npm install
            - this command will create the nodes modules folder based on package.json
    - now run the dev server
        npm run dev
            - remember this is only a development server and not a production grade server
            - mostly we use nginx as a production server
    - open a browser and copy the url displayed to see the index.html file of your react app
        http://localhost:5174/


jsx
    - javascript xml
    - an extension of javascript
    - generally in JS we cannot wirte Html
    - but in JSX we can write html tags in JS
    - react uses JSX

components are the building blocks of react
component is a section/part of the webpage
components are reusable
we already have a component called App
this is the root component
now we have to create our own componens and use them

public folder vs src/assets folder
----------------------------------
- the assets inside the public folder is not bundled with the react project
- the assets inside the src/assets folder is bundled with the react project
