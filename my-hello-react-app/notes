- ReactJs is not a framework, it is a library
- to create a react project we need npm(node package manager)
- we get the npm from node js and hence we have to install node js to create a react project
- how do we create a react project ?
------------------------------------
	- CRA (create-react-app)

	- vite
		- speed and performance
		- bundling time is less, almost half the time CRA takes. beacause it uses ESModule bundling whereas CRA uses webpack	
		- HMR - Hot module replacement
- lets create a reat project using vite
----------------------------------------
    - create a folder and open it in vscode
    - open the terminal in vscode and type the command
            npm create vite@latest
    - will ask for some options like name of project(give a name), framework(choose react - though react is not a framework), underlying language (choose javascript) 
    - now a react project is created without node modules folder
    - now use
        cd <project name>
    - now install node modules using
        npm install
            - this command will create the nodes modules based on package.json
    - now run the dev server
        npm run dev
            - remember this is only a dev server and not a production grade server

    - open a browser and copy the url displayed to see the index.html file of your react app
        http://localhost:5174/
